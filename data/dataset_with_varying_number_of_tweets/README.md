## Dataset Acknowledgment

This project utilizes a curated Twitter dataset intended for authorship attribution research. The dataset consists of 20,000 tweets collected from 100 verified users. It is compiled from the following source files:

* `100_users_with_200_tweets.csv`
* `200_users_with_200_tweets.csv`
* `500_users_with_200_tweets.csv`

These files contain collections of authentic Twitter content organized by user group size. Each user has contributed approximately 200 tweets.

**Disclaimer:** The original compilers and curators of this dataset are unknown. While we did not create the dataset, we acknowledge their effort and contribution.

The dataset is used strictly for academic and research purposes in compliance with Twitterâ€™s Developer Policy and applicable ethical standards.
